A Web page that plays videos depending on the user's decision.

# Demo

Just open the [Demo](https://felix-franz.github.io/StoryTellerWebpage/) an try to press 'a' or 'b'.

## How to configure

Just go in the `story.json` and place your story ðŸ˜‰.
You only need to change the story items. the video that should be displayed at the beginn need to be named start.

The video and decision Property need to be a link to a video that should be displayed while this story item is active. After the video is played the decision video will be played in a loop.
action1, action2, ... need to contain the next story item depending on the key press.
```json
"name of the story": {
        "video": "video url",
        "decision": "video url of desicion video",
        "action1": "name of story item",
        "action2": "name of story item"
    }
```

You can also change name of the start story item and the actions inside the `storyTellerWebpage.js`.

To change the start name just change change the `sCurrent` variable to whatever you want.

Changing the keys is also very easy, you only need to change the `actions` variable.
In following example the action a opens the next story item behind the action1 (from the story.json).
You can add more actions or have multiple actions doing the same, just add more actions.

```json
var actions = {
    "a" : "action1",
    "b" : "action2"
}
```

It is also possible to add more than two decisions per story item.
Therefore you need to add a new action (e.g. action3) to each story item and add a key for this
